The following performance enhancements have been implemented:


  1. C++ Native Renderer (Zen Engine)
   * Point Sprite Rendering: Refactored the particle system to use Point Sprites (QSGGeometry::DrawPoints) instead of quads. This reduces
     the vertex data sent to the GPU by 75% (1 vertex per particle vs. 4) and completely eliminates the need for an index buffer.
   * Memory Optimization: Removed the redundant m_particlesRender buffer and its associated memcpy operations, reducing CPU overhead and
     memory footprint.
   * Shader Modernization: Updated particle.vert and particle.frag to utilize gl_PointSize and gl_PointCoord, implementing procedural radial
     glow directly in the fragment shader for maximum efficiency.
   * Compact Vertex Layout: Optimized the ParticleVertex structure to 16 bytes (Position, Size, Packed Color), ensuring better cache
     locality and lower bus bandwidth.


  2. Web Renderer (WebGL Engine)
   * Update Throttling: Implemented a timer-based update mechanism in WebRenderer.qml. This prevents the QML-to-JavaScript bridge from being
     flooded with runJavaScript calls during rapid configuration changes, significantly improving UI responsiveness and reducing Chromium
     process overhead.


  The project has been successfully rebuilt and packaged into tao-widget.plasmoid. These changes ensure that the widget remains fluid even
  at its maximum capacity of 20,000 particles.
